# Email System Implementation Guide

## Overview
A complete email system has been implemented using Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP for the doctor appointment booking system. The system handles:

1. **Appointment Booking Confirmations** - Sent to users when they book appointments
2. **Admin Notifications** - Sent to admin when new appointments are booked
3. **Appointment Approval Emails** - Sent to users when admin approves their appointments
4. **Admin Management System** - For adding and managing admin users

## Email Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env.local)
```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_EMAIL=soumodipddas2005@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=hckbxnfoefewjktv
ADMIN_EMAIL=soumodipddas2005@gmail.com
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Email Flow

### 1. User Books Appointment
- **Trigger**: User submits appointment form
- **Action**: 
  - Saves appointment to Firebase with status 'pending'
  - Sends confirmation email to user
  - Sends notification email to admin
- **User receives**: "Appointment Request Received - Confirmation Pending"
- **Admin receives**: "New Appointment Request - Action Required"

### 2. Admin Approves Appointment
- **Trigger**: Admin clicks "Approve" in dashboard
- **Action**: 
  - Updates appointment status to 'approved'
  - Sends approval confirmation email to user
- **User receives**: "✅ Appointment Confirmed - Dr. Medical Center"
