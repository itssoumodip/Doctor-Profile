// ⚠️ DEPRECATED: This file is no longer used to avoid Next.js build errors.
// All email functionality has been moved directly into API routes.
// See:

// - /app/api/send-approval-email/route.js  
// - /app/api/test-email/route.js
//
// This file is kept for reference only. DO NOT IMPORT FROM THIS FILE.
// The previous email service implementation has been moved to individual API routes
// to prevent Next.js build errors caused by importing Node.js modules like Nodemailer
// in client-side code.
